1)
turn off LD1 and LD2

To get rid of the Nucleo LEDs that are constantly on or even flashing it's needed to remove LEDs or this resistors:

    R18 to disable red part of the ST-link's red/green LED LD1
    R17 or R19 (or both) to disable green part of the ST-link's red/green LED LD1
    R22 to disable the always on red LED LD2

Remove resistors from the Nucleo board before assembling it to the PCB, because they are on the bottom side of Nucleo (under red/green LED) and will be unreachable.
